# Unreadable Clocks

\<\<pages Link>>

A random idea a friend came up with to create a clock which displayed the hours and minutes in a jumbled format. These both work as real clocks... if you can read them. Both clocks can be seen working in the link above.

# 12 Hour Clock

Clock which displays the time in the 12-hour format.
